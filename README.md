## üë©‚Äçüíª Welcome to my Technical Writing Portfolio
Hello! My name is Hannah. Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to review my technical writing portfolio.

Here is some quick information about me: I hold a Bachelor's Degree in English concentrating in Linguistics and in May 2023 I will hold a Master's Degree in English concentrating in Linguistics (focusing on Computational Linguistics). I have over 3 years of experience in content writing, copywriting, technical writing, and editing. You can lear more about me and my qualifications by check out my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-brennan-ba9562ab "Hannah Brennan LinkedIn").

I transitioned into a Technical writing role a year ago, and my current work is proprietary. I have created this portfolio to address this gap in sharing my writing. My writing samples include a [User Manual](https://github.com/hannahbrenn/hannah-brennan-portfolio#-sample-1-ultrasound-user-manual "Sample 1") and [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/hannahbrenn/hannah-brennan-portfolio#iphone-sample-2-asana-quick-start-guide "Sample 2").

This is where I have uploaded my writing samples. Below you will find an explanation of each document, which can be found above in the indicated file name.

### üíª [Sample 1: Ultrasound User Manual](https://github.com/hannahbrenn/hannah-brennan-portfolio/blob/main/Ultrasound_User_Manual.pdf "Ultrasound User Manual")
#### üìÇ Context
I worked on a project called the Non-Native Articulatory Corpus produced by George Mason University's Phonetics Lab (PhonLab). This lab newly received ultrasound equipment and software to be used in the phonetics research. The PhonLab required a user manual specialized the the equipment and layout of the lab and sound booth for research assistants to use and maintain the equipment and software.

This User Manual outlines the steps needed to put together and use the ultrasound equipment as well as the steps needed to use the software for image and audio analysis.

The target audience of this user manual are the research assistance and professors at George Mason University who will need use of the PhonLab and its equipment. The users do not need to have prior experience using ultrasound equipment, but will require knowledge of phonetics to understand the software.

### :iphone: [Sample 2: Asana Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/hannahbrenn/hannah-brennan-portfolio/blob/main/Brennan_Asana_QuickStart_Guide.pdf "Asana Quick Start Guide")
#### :open_file_folder: Context
I have used the organizational tool [Asana](https://www.asana.com) in my previous jobs and personal task keeping. In order to introduce this tool to new team members, I have created a Quick Start Guide to introduce new users to the features of the application. 

In this quickstart guide, I aim to:
1. Cover the basic tools of the application,
2. Make instructions easy to follow for non-tech savvy users, and
3. Opt for the most straigthforward method, with a description of the two main pages without any required order of use.

The target audience of this quick start guide is non-technical people using the Asana application. The users do not need to be familiar with the application.
