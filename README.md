## 👩‍💻 Welcome to my Technical Writing Portfolio
Hello! My name is Hannah. Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to review my technical writing portfolio.
Here is some quick information about me: I hold a Bachelor's Degree in English concentrating in Linguistics and in May 2023 I will hold a Master's Degree in English concentrating in Linguistics (focusing on Computational Linguistics). I have over 3 years of experience in content writing, copywriting, technical writing, and editing. You can lear more about me and my qualifications by check out my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-brennan-ba9562ab "Hannah Brennan LinkedIn").

I transitioned into a Technical writing role a year ago, and my current work is proprietary. I have created this portfolio to address this gap in sharing my writing. My writing samples include a User Manual.

This is where I have uploaded my writing samples. Below you will find an explanation of each document, which can be found above in the indicated file name.

### 💻 [Sample 1: Ultrasound User Manual](https://github.com/hannahbrenn/hannah-brennan-portfolio/blob/main/Ultrasound_User_Manual.pdf "Ultrasound User Manual")
#### 📂 Context
I worked on a project called the Non-Native Articulatory Corpus produced by George Mason University's Phonetics Lab (PhonLab). This lab newly received ultrasound equipment and software to be used in the phonetics research. The PhonLab required a user manual specialized the the equipment and layout of the lab and sound booth for research assistants to use and maintain the equipment and software.
This User Manual outlines the steps needed to put together and use the ultrasound equipment as well as the steps needed to use the software for image and audio analysis.
